Current update (as of 4/23-34):
Everything on the front end is hooked up and working correctly- it responds dynamically, all it needs is the queries and
a bit of data modification on the backend side. Signing up a new account has not been fixed- information entered while in the
modal does not remain; other sign in information is retained as expected (i.e., if you enter your username and password when you
already have an account, it will be recorded correctly and return you to the front page).
